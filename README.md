# Working 

Users interact with the terminal interface by inputting command line code, which serves as instructions for the emulator to execute various tasks. This input serves as the primary means through which users communicate with the emulator, providing commands, queries, or requests for assistance.

Upon receiving user input, the emulator evaluates the complexity and nature of the command. If the input command is deemed straightforward and does not require additional assistance or processing, it is executed as a regular command within the terminal environment. 

Users can utilize the "AI" button to access advanced assistance for their coding tasks. Upon clicking the button, users are prompted to input their query in natural language, enabling them toexpress their coding-related concerns or seek clarification on specific commands or tasks. Behind the scenes, the emulator's backend processes the user's input using OpenAI's powerful capabilities. Through natural language processing algorithms, the system comprehends the user's query and generates a tailored response. This response includes not only the appropriate command executionbut also a detailed explanation, elucidating the command's functionality and usage.

In addition to AI assistance, users have the option to seek help or resolve errors by clicking on dedicated buttons within the terminal interface. When users click on the "Help" button, the system prompts them to provide clarification or additional context regarding their coding issue. Leveraging prompt engineering techniques, the emulator generates a solution tailored to the user's specific query. Similarly, clicking on the "Error" button allows users to specify the encountered issue, such as a syntax error or unexpected behavior. The system then generates a solution that not only corrects the error but also provides an explanation of the corrected command.
